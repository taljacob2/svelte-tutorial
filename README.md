# Svelte + TS + Vite: Tutorial

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and TypeScript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

> ## Need an official Svelte framework?
> 
> Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploy anywhere with its serverless-first approach and > adapt to various platforms, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, > Tailwind CSS, and more.

## Installation

We will use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) for initializing a new Svelte project.
Simply run:
```
npm create vite@latest
```
Choose a name for your project. For example `my-project`.

Then choose to initialize `svelte` with one of the two options:
- [svelte](https://vite.new/svelte)
- [svelte-ts](https://vite.new/svelte-ts)

My recommendation is to chose `svelte-ts`, because then you will be able to
both code in `.ts` and `.js` - so you won't be limited there, as opposed to
if you would pick `svelte` and you would then be limited only for `.js`.

Then run:
```
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
```
